 * record is accurate even if the payout account is later soft-deleted or if
 * its editable metadata changes. Snapshot columns are immutable after creation.
 *
 * `snapshot_payout_method` is the source of truth for which snapshot fields are
 * populated:
 *   bank_transfer — snapshotBankAccountNumber, snapshotBankIfscCode are NOT NULL
 *   upi           — snapshotUpiId is NOT NULL
 *
 * `snapshotBankAccountNumber` and `snapshotBankIfscCode` are nullable because
 * UPI withdrawals do not have a bank account number or IFSC code. They are
 * never NULL for bank_transfer withdrawals (enforced at the service layer).

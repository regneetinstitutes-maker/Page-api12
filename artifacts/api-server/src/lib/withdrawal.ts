/**
 * Withdrawal service — initiation and cancellation.
 *
 * ── Responsibility boundary ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   This module owns:
 *     - initiateWithdrawal   — create a withdrawal + reservation atomically
 *     - cancelWithdrawal     — cancel (only valid from `reserved` state)
 *     - getWithdrawal        — fetch a single withdrawal with ownership check
 *     - getUserWithdrawals   — paginated list for a user
 *
 *   withdrawal-completion.ts owns completeWithdrawal and failWithdrawal (shared
 *   by the webhook path and the reconciliation job).
 *
 * ── Concurrency contract ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   All mutations acquire a FOR UPDATE lock on the wallet account FIRST, before
 *   reading any derived state (idempotency key, active withdrawal count). This
 *   serializes all concurrent withdrawal requests from the same user against the
 *   same lock, closing the TOCTOU window between "check no active withdrawal"
 *   and "create reservation".
 *
 *   Lock order for mutations that touch an existing withdrawal row:
 *     1. withdrawal row  (FOR UPDATE)
 *     2. wallet account  (FOR UPDATE — inside releaseReservation)
 *     3. reservation row (FOR UPDATE — inside releaseReservation)
 *
 *   This order is consistent with withdrawal-completion.ts and prevents deadlocks
 *   between concurrent cancellations and webhook completions.
 *
 * ── Limits extensibility ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   Per-request, daily, and monthly limits are not implemented. The architecture
 *   is ready: add a `checkWithdrawalLimits(tx, userId, amount)` call inside
 *   `initiateWithdrawal` (after the wallet lock, before the reservation) without
 *   touching any other code path.
